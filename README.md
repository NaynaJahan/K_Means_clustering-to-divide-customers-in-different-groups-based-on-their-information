# K_Means_clustering-to-divide-customers-in-different-groups-based-on-their-information.ipynb
Using K-Means clustering we will identify patterns within customers based on a depended variable that takes two dimensions(Annual income and Spending Score of the customer) and divide the customers in different groups/clusters. Elbow method is used to find the optimal number of clusters, where value of WCSS drops very slowly.
